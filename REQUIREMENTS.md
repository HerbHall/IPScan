# IPScan Requirements Specification

## Overview

IPScan is a Windows network device discovery tool that locates HTTP-enabled devices on the local subnet and presents them in an accessible interface for configuration.

**Current Project Status**: The application has a complete GUI framework with theming support, but core network scanning functionality is not yet implemented. The project is in early development with foundational architecture in place.

**📋 Key Implementation Decisions**: See [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) for comprehensive design decisions made from requirements questionnaire (network interfaces, storage, admin privileges, port scanning, notifications, and more). All blocker questions answered - development can proceed with Phase 1.

## Quick Start for Developers

### Building the Project

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd d:\Code Projects\IPScan

# Build all projects
dotnet build src/IPScan.Core/IPScan.Core.csproj
dotnet build src/IPScan.GUI/IPScan.GUI.csproj
dotnet build src/IPScan.CLI/IPScan.CLI.csproj

# Run the GUI (to see current state)
dotnet run --project src/IPScan.GUI/IPScan.GUI.csproj
```

### What Works Now
- ✓ GUI application launches with splash screen
- ✓ Theme system (CRT Green, Light, Dark, Windows System)
- ✓ Settings dialog with theme customization
- ✓ Edit device dialog (UI only, no backend)
- ✓ Window position/size memory across sessions
- ✓ Multi-monitor support

### What Doesn't Work Yet
- ❌ Network scanning (shows empty device list)
- ❌ Device discovery and storage
- ❌ CLI commands (all return "not yet implemented")
- ❌ Port scanning
- ❌ Settings persistence (changes don't save)

### Critical Next Steps to Make It Functional

**Priority 1: Make Settings Persist**
1. Implement `JsonSettingsService.cs` to save/load settings from `%APPDATA%\IPScan\settings.json`
2. Wire up settings service to GUI SettingsWindow

**Priority 2: Implement Basic Network Scanning**
1. Implement `SubnetCalculator.cs` to determine scan range
2. Implement `NetworkInterfaceService.cs` to detect active interfaces
3. Implement `NetworkScanner.cs` for ping sweep and basic device detection
4. Implement `JsonDeviceRepository.cs` to persist discovered devices

**Priority 3: Connect GUI to Backend**
1. Wire up MainWindow to DeviceManager
2. Display discovered devices in tree view
3. Update device list in real-time during scans
4. Implement scan button functionality

### Documentation

- Standard CLI usage with `--help` documentation for each feature
- GUI help file accessible via File > Help menu

## Technical Requirements

### Platform

- **Target:** Windows 10/11
- **Future consideration:** Cross-platform port if demand warrants

### Technology Stack

- **Framework:** .NET 10.0
- **Language:** C#
- **GUI:** WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
- **CLI:** System.CommandLine
- **Versioning:** MinVer (automatic Git-based SemVer)

### Versioning Strategy

Uses [MinVer](https://github.com/adamralph/minver) for automatic semantic versioning based on Git tags:

| Scenario | Version Example |
|----------|-----------------|
| Tagged release `v1.0.0` | `1.0.0` |
| 3 commits after `v1.0.0` | `1.0.1-alpha.0.3` |
| No tags yet | `0.0.0-alpha.0.1` |

**Usage:**
- Create a release: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags`
- Version auto-increments patch for commits after a tag
- Pre-release suffix added automatically between tags

### Libraries

| Purpose | Library | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Network scanning | SharpPcap, System.Net.NetworkInformation | SharpPcap referenced, implementation pending |
| CLI parsing | Custom implementation | Basic structure complete |

```

**Missing Project Infrastructure:**

The following standard project files are not yet created:
- ❌ `IPScan.sln` - Solution file for building all projects together
- ❌ `tests/IPScan.Core.Tests/` - Unit tests for core services
- ❌ `tests/IPScan.CLI.Tests/` - CLI integration tests
- ❌ `LICENSE` - License file (MIT license specified in requirements)
- ❌ `docs/` - User and developer documentation

**Workaround**: Projects can be built individually:
```bash
dotnet build src/IPScan.Core/IPScan.Core.csproj
dotnet build src/IPScan.GUI/IPScan.GUI.csproj
dotnet build src/IPScan.CLI/IPScan.CLI.csproj
```

**To create solution file:**
```bash
dotnet new sln -n IPScan
dotnet sln add src/IPScan.Core/IPScan.Core.csproj
dotnet sln add src/IPScan.GUI/IPScan.GUI.csproj
dotnet sln add src/IPScan.CLI/IPScan.CLI.csproj
```

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- Network scan should complete within reasonable time for /24 subnet
- Responsive UI during scanning operations (async/background tasks)

### Security

- Credentials stored using Windows Credential Manager via SecretManager
- No plaintext password storage
- Device data stored in user's AppData folder

### Quality Assurance

- Unit tests for core scanning and detection logic
- Integration tests for CLI commands
- Automated testing via `dotnet test`
- All code should implement null checking and arguement validation techniques to ensure data validity to prevent runtime crashes.

## Data Storage

### Device Data (JSON)

**Status**: Model defined, JSON persistence not yet implemented
**Location**: `%APPDATA%\IPScan\devices.json` (planned)

**Planned Structure (Full Feature Set):**
```json
{
  "devices": [
    {
      "id": "guid",
      "name": "Router",
      "hostname": "router.local",
      "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1",
      "macAddress": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",

      "isOnline": true,
      "ports": [                                  // ❌ Not in current model
        { "port": 80, "protocol": "tcp", "service": "HTTP", "serviceCategory": "Web", "url": "http://192.168.1.1" },
        { "port": 443, "protocol": "tcp", "service": "HTTPS", "serviceCategory": "Web", "url": "https://192.168.1.1" },
        { "port": 22, "protocol": "tcp", "service": "SSH", "serviceCategory": "RemoteAccess" }
      ],
      "firstDiscovered": "2026-01-20T08:00:00Z",
      "lastSeen": "2026-01-25T10:30:00Z",
      "consecutiveMissedScans": 0,               // ✓ In current model
      "userOverrides": {                         // ❌ Not in current model
        "name": null,
        "hardwareCategory": null,
        "connectionType": null
      },
      "notes": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

**Current Model (Device.cs) Supports:**
```json
{
  "id": "guid",           // ✓
  "name": "Router",       // ✓
  "hostname": "router.local",  // ✓
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1",  // ✓
  "macAddress": "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF",  // ✓ (nullable)
  "isOnline": true,       // ✓
  "firstDiscovered": "2026-01-20T08:00:00Z",  // ✓
  "lastSeen": "2026-01-25T10:30:00Z",         // ✓
  "consecutiveMissedScans": 0,  // ✓
  "notes": ""             // ✓
}
```

**Note**: The current Device model is a minimal viable structure. Port scanning, categorization, and manufacturer detection will require extending this model in future phases.

   - Update `app.manifest` for both GUI and CLI projects
   - Set `requireAdministrator` to enable full network capabilities
   - Test elevation on Windows 10/11

**1.2 Single Instance Control**
   - Implement named Mutex to prevent multiple instances
   - Show "already running" error dialog with option to bring existing window to front
   - Note: File locking for concurrent CLI/GUI access deferred to Phase 2

**1.3 Storage System with Fallback**
   - Implement `JsonSettingsService.cs` for settings persistence
   - Primary location: `%APPDATA%\IPScan\settings.json`
   - Fallback strategy:
     - On storage failure, run in memory-only mode
     - Show persistent warning banner
     - Prompt user: "Use local directory" or "Continue without saving"
     - Save choice in registry for next launch
   - Implement `JsonDeviceRepository.cs` for device storage
   - Support memory-only operation (no persistence)

#### 2. Network Scanning - Core Implementation

**2.2 Primary Interface Scanning** (IPv4 Only)
   - Implement `SubnetCalculator.cs` for IPv4 subnet detection
   - Implement `NetworkScanner.cs` using SharpPcap and System.Net.NetworkInformation
   - Async ping sweep with configurable concurrency
   - Hostname resolution (DNS/mDNS)
   - MAC address discovery via ARP (requires admin)
   - Note: IPv6 support deferred to Phase 3+

**2.3 Multi-Interface Support** (After primary scan works)
   - After primary scan completes, detect additional non-VPN interfaces
   - If found, prompt user: "Additional interfaces detected. Scan them too?"
